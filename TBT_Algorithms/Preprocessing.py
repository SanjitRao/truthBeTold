#(DELETE THIS LATER): This python file is meant to collect, extract the raw text if needed, and preprocess the text as needed.
# It may be prudent to check if the stopwords, punctuation, #capital letters, etc. give any indication of misinformation.
# The goal of this file should be to see 1) what kind of preprocessing & vectorization is actually needed and 2) create a
# feature function that takes into account the stop words, lemmas, etc (whatever we decide on, if that makes sense)
# - don't do cosine similarity. Skip right to Word2Vec (or TF-IDF at the very LEAST)
# - see how Beautiful soup, dfs, newspaper, etc could be used to build a framework for gathering text from an article(s)
    #- this will likely be a long process, so create a good structure to set in motion
