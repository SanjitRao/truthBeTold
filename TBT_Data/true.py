    "Interstate 69 in Michigan enters that state south of Coldwater and passes the cities of Lansing and Flint in " \
    "the Lower Peninsula. I-69 is a part of the Interstate Highway System, and will eventually run from the " \
    "Mexican border in Texas to the Canadian border at Port Huron, Michigan. A north–south freeway from the " \
    "Indiana–Michigan border to the Lansing area, it changes direction to east–west after running concurrently " \
    "with I-96. The freeway continues to Port Huron before terminating in the middle of the twin-span Blue Water " \
    "Bridge while running concurrently with I-94 at the border. There are four related business loops for I-69 in " \
    "the state, connecting the freeway to adjacent cities. Predecessors to I-69 include the first M-29, " \
    "US Highway 27 (US 27), M-78 and M-21. The freeway was not included on the original Interstate Highway System " \
    "planning maps in the mid-1950s, but it was added in 1958 along a shorter route. Michigan built segments of " \
    "freeway for the future Interstate in the 1960s, and the state was granted additional Interstate mileage in " \
    "1968 to extend I-69 north and east to Flint. Later extensions in 1973 and 1987 resulted in the modern " \
    "highway. The first freeway segment designated as I-69 in Michigan opened in 1967, and the last was completed " \
    "in 1992, finishing Michigan's Interstate System. US 27 previously ran concurrently with I-69 from the " \
    "Indiana–Michigan state line north to the Lansing area, but this designation was removed in 2002. ",

    "About 60 cm (24 in) in length, this species has two distinct colour morphs, charcoal-grey (as seen here) " \
    "and pure white. The bird's diet consists mainly of fish, crustaceans and molluscs. This Pacific reef heron " \

    "Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Baroness Thatcher, LG, OM, DStJ, PC, FRS, HonFRSC (née Roberts; 13 October 1925 – " \
    "8 April 2013) was a British stateswoman who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to " \
    "1990 and Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990. She was the longest-serving British prime " \
    "minister of the 20th century and the first woman to hold that office. A Soviet journalist dubbed her the " \
    "Iron Lady, a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As " \
    "prime minister, she implemented policies that became known as Thatcherism. ",
    "Thatcher studied chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, and worked briefly as a research chemist, " \
    "before becoming a barrister. She was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath " \
    "appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970–1974 government. In 1975, " \
    "she defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition, " \
    "the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom. On becoming prime minister after " \
    "winning the 1979 general election, Thatcher introduced a series of economic policies intended to reverse " \
    "high inflation and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an oncoming recession.[" \
    "nb 1] Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial " \
    "sector), the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. " \
    "Her popularity in her first years in office waned amid recession and rising unemployment, until victory in " \
    "the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her " \
    "landslide re-election in 1983. She survived an assassination attempt by the Provisional IRA in the 1984 " \
    "Brighton hotel bombing and achieved a political victory against the National Union of Mineworkers in the " \
    "1984–85 miners' strike.  Thatcher was re-elected for a third term with another landslide in 1987, " \
    "but her subsequent support for the Community Charge (poll tax) was widely unpopular, and her increasingly " \
    "Eurosceptic views on the European Community were not shared by others in her cabinet. She resigned as prime " \
    "minister and party leader in 1990, after a challenge was launched to her leadership.[nb 2] After retiring " \
    "from the Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher (of Kesteven in the County of " \
    "Lincolnshire) which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords. In 2013, she died of a stroke at the Ritz " \
    "Hotel, London, at the age of 87. ",
    "The rock martin (Ptyonoprogne fuligula) is a small swallow that is resident in central and southern Africa. " \
    "It breeds in the mountains, and at lower levels in rocky areas and towns. It has mainly brown plumage and " \
    "white windows on the spread tail. Its call is a soft twitter. The sexes are similar in appearance. The " \
    "martin hunts along cliff faces for flying insects. It breeds under cliff overhangs or on man-made " \
    "structures using mud pellets to build a bowl or half-bowl nest with a soft lining. The bird is a solitary " \
    "breeder, but small groups may nest close together in suitable locations. A typical clutch has two to three " \
    "eggs, which are white with brown and grey blotches. Both adults incubate the eggs for 16–19 days and feed " \
    "the chicks. Fledging takes another 22–24 days. The small martin is caught in flight by several falcons, " \
    "such as hobbies, but it faces no major threats. Because of its extensive range and large stable population, " \
    "it is assessed as a least-concern species on the IUCN Red List. (This article is part of a featured topic: " \
    "Crag martins.) ",
    "Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The " \
    "game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the " \
    "batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball " \
    "into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around " \
    "four bases to score what are called runs. The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent " \
    "batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases.[2] A run is scored when a " \
    "runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player " \
    "started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner. ",
    "The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older " \
    "of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. Founded on " \
    "February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP) of " \
    "1871–1875 (often called simply the National Association), the NL is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, " \
    "in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later and is called the " \
    "Junior Circuit. ",
    "Major League Baseball (MLB) is an American professional baseball organization and the oldest of the major " \
    "professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. A total of 30 teams play in Major League " \
    "Baseball: 15 teams in the National League (NL) and 15 in the American League (AL). The NL and AL were " \
    "formed in 1876 and 1901, respectively. Beginning in 1903, the two leagues cooperated but remained legally " \
    "separate entities until 2000 when they merged into a single organization led by the Commissioner of " \
    "Baseball.[9][10] The league is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan. ",
    "Baseball's first openly all-professional team was the Cincinnati Red Stockings, who were founded in 1869. " \
    "Before that, some teams had secretly paid some players. The first few decades of professional baseball were " \
    "characterized by rivalries between leagues and by players who often jumped from one team or league to " \
    "another. The period before 1920 is known as the dead-ball era, during which players would rarely hit home " \
    "runs. Professional baseball in the United States survived a conspiracy to fix the 1919 World Series, " \
    "which came to be known as the Black Sox Scandal. The sport rose in popularity in the 1920s and survived " \
    "potential downturns during the Great Depression and World War II. Shortly after the war, Jackie Robinson " \
    "broke baseball's color barrier. ",
    "The 1950s and 1960s were a time of club expansion and relocation for the AL and NL. New stadiums and " \
    "artificial turf surfaces began to change the game in the 1970s and 1980s. Home runs dominated the game " \
    "during the 1990s, and media reports began to discuss the use of anabolic steroids among MLB players in the " \
    "mid-2000s. In 2006, an investigation produced the Mitchell Report, which implicated many players in the use " \
    "of performance-enhancing substances, including at least one player from each team. ",
    "As of 2021, MLB is composed of 30 teams: 29 in the United States and 1 in Canada. Teams play 162 games " \
    "each season and five teams in each league advance to a four-round postseason tournament that culminates in " \
    "the World Series, a best-of-seven championship series between the two league champions that dates to 1903. " \
    "Baseball games are broadcast on television, radio, and the Internet throughout North America and in " \
    "several other countries. MLB has the highest total season attendance of any sports league in the world " \
    "with more than 69.6 million spectators in 2018. ",
    "The game is usually played on the second or third Tuesday in July, and is meant to mark the symbolic " \
    "halfway point of the MLB season (though not the mathematical halfway point, which, for most seasons, " \
    "falls within the previous calendar week). Both leagues share an All-Star break, with no regular-season " \
    "games scheduled from the day before through two days[2] after the All-Star Game. Some additional events " \
    "and festivities associated with the game take place each year close to and during this break in the " \
    "regular season. ",

    "treated as a subphylum under the clade Mandibulata; because of recent molecular studies it is now well " \
    "accepted that the crustacean group is paraphyletic, and comprises all animals in the clade Pancrustacea " \

    "There was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election. In fact, election officials from both political parties "
    "stated publicly that the election went well, and international observers confirmed there were no serious "
    "irregularities. Trump’s campaign has tried to mount legal challenges across the country, but many of the "
    "lawsuits have been thrown out and none has included any evidence that the outcome might be reversed. ",

    "In recent days, Trump appeared to be inching closer to acknowledging the reality of his loss. In comments Friday "
    "in the Rose Garden about a coronavirus vaccine, Trump said his administration would “not be going to a lockdown” "
    "to slow the spread of COVID-19, and added that whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it "
    "will be? I guess time will tell. ",
    "Having none of that was Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney who is helping lead Trump’s national "
    "legal front on the election challenge. In a television appearance that Trump previewed on Twitter after his "
    "morning tweets, Giuliani denied Trump was conceding — “No, no, no, far from it.” ",

    "Ten people, including nine children, were killed Saturday in a 15-vehicle crash about 35 miles (55 kilometers) "
    "south of Montgomery on Interstate 65, according to Butler County Coroner Wayne Garlock. ",
    "He said the vehicles likely hydroplaned on wet roads, with eight children, ages 4 to 17, killed in a van "
    "belonging to a youth ranch operated by the Alabama Sheriffs Association for abused or neglected children. Two "
    "people died in separate vehicle, Garlock told local news outlets — 29-year-old Cody Fox and 9-month-old Ariana "
    "Fox, both of Marion County, Tennessee.  Multiple people were also injured.  Meanwhile, a 24-year-old man and a "
    "3-year-old boy were killed when a tree fell on their house just outside the Tuscaloosa city limits Saturday, "
    "Capt. Marty Sellers of the Tuscaloosa Violent Crimes Unit told The Tuscaloosa News.  The deaths occurred as "
    "drenching rains pelted northern Alabama and Georgia late Saturday. As much as 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain "
    "was reported earlier from Claudette along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. ",
    "Flash flood watches were posted Sunday for northern Georgia, most of South Carolina, the North Carolina coast, "
    "parts of southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. A tropical storm warning was in effect in North Carolina "
    "from the Little River Inlet to the town of Duck on the Outer Banks. A tropical storm watch was issued from South "
    "Santee River, South Carolina, to the Little River Inlet, forecasters said.  The eight children killed in the van "
    "were returning to a youth ranch operated by the Alabama Sheriffs Association near Camp Hill, northeast of "
    "Montgomery, from a week at the beach in Gulf Shores, youth ranches CEO Michael Smith told The Associated Press. "
    "The van caught fire after the wreck. Candice Gulley, the director of the Tallapoosa County ranch, was rescued "
    "and was hospitalized in Montgomery, Smith said. Her condition wasn’t immediately available. At least one of the "
    "dead was Gulley’s child, Smith said.  “This is the worst tragedy I’ve been a part of in my life,” said Smith, "
    "who was driving Sunday to Camp Hill to talk to the remaining residents, who had returned from Gulf Shores in a "
    "separate van and did not see the wreck.  “Words cannot explain what I saw,” Smith said of the accident site, "
    "which he visited Saturday. “We love these girls like they’re our own children.”  Garlock said the location of "
    "the wreck is “notorious” for hydroplaning, as the northbound highway curves down a hill to a small creek. "

    "The Tallapoosa County school system said counselors would be available Sunday at Reeltown High School, "
    "where some of the ranch residents were students. Smith said the ranch, which is Christian-based, would likely "
    "have a memorial service later, asking for prayers as he began to cry.  Gulley, the lone survivor from the van, "
    "had worked with children for years, beginning when she and her husband were house parents at the ranch for seven "
    "years.  “During those years, there have been 74 girls that have come through our house and called us mom and "
    "dad,” she told the Opelika-Auburn News in August 2019. She said she then became a relief parent, working on "
    "fundraising and being involved in the community, before she became the ranch director.  Top winds from Claudette "
    "remained near 30 mph (45 kph) on Sunday. National Hurricane Center forecasters predicted it would strengthen "

    "The center of Claudette’s disorganized circulation was located about 15 miles (20 kilometers) east-northeast of "
    "Atlanta on Sunday morning. It was moving east-northeast at 17 mph (28 kph), the National Hurricane Center said.  "
    "Aside from rainy weather, it seemed to be business as usual along North Carolina’s Outer Banks on Sunday.  At "
    "Ace Hardware in Avon, shift manager David Swartwood said they were preparing for whatever might come, "
    "but the overall sense was that it wouldn’t be that bad. He said winds from the south don’t usually cause huge "
    "flooding problems, so “we don’t really anticipate any bad scenarios.”  “Everybody here has been through it many, "
    "many times, so we’re used to the drill,” he said. “We’ve been prepared.”  For the hardware store, he said, "
    "that means having supplies like flashlights, batteries, tarps, generators, ropes and sandbags on hand. As of "
    "Sunday morning, there wasn’t a huge rush for those items.  At Stack ’em High in Kill Devil Hills, a restaurant "
    "that specializes in pancakes, co-owner Dawn Kiousis said Sunday morning restaurant service was busy.  “We’re "
    "serving just like normal,” she said. “As far as I’m aware, it’s not going to be too much of a hazard for us.”  "
    "“You keep your eye on the weather and you prepare as much stuff in advance as you can,” she said. “Just know "
    "she’s gonna win. Mother nature is going to do what she’s going to do, so you just prepare.”  Separately, "
    "Tropical Storm Dolores made landfall on Mexico’s west coast with near-hurricane force. As of Sunday morning, "
    "it had dissipated over Mexico. Its remnants had maximum sustained winds of 25 mph (35 kph), and it was centered "
    "about 170 miles (275 kilometers) east of Mazatlan, Mexico. ",
    "TULAROSA, N.M. (AP) — He rodeoed in a Buffalo Bill-style Wild West show, carried his message on horseback from "
    "the Holy Land to Times Square and was invited to the White House to meet the president.  But luck may have run "
    "out for this cowboy pastor who rode to national political fame by embracing President Donald Trump with a series "
    "of horseback caravans and came crashing down with a defiant stand Jan. 6 against President Joe Biden’s election. "
    " Today, Couy Griffin is divorced, disparaged by family and confronts a political recall drive, "
    "a state corruption investigation and federal charges.  And yet he remains determined. He sees himself as "
    "governor one day.  The first-term county commissioner forged a group of rodeo acquaintances in 2019 into a "
    "promotional Cowboys for Trump posse to spread his conservative message about gun rights, immigration controls "
    "and abortion restrictions.  Trump’s election defeat has left the 47-year-old father in a lonely fight for his "
    "political life after preaching to crowds at the U.S. Capitol siege, promising to take his guns to Biden’s "
    "inauguration and landing in jail for over a week.  In Washington, prosecutors unveiled photographs of Griffin "
    "climbing a toppled fence and another barrier to access the Capitol steps.  Public defense attorneys say a close "
    "reading of the law shows the area wasn’t off limits. They say Griffin didn’t partake in violence and was well "
    "within his free speech rights as he voiced election grievances and attempted to lead a prayer with a bullhorn.  "
    "Griffin is one of thousands of Trump loyalists in public office who are charting an uncertain future ahead of "
    "the 2022 election cycle. He’s part of a smaller cadre who flirted with insurrection on Trump’s behalf and may "
    "still pay a high price. In all, more than 400 people were charged in the insurrection, which left five dead and "
    "dozens of officers injured.  Griffin has been rebuked by some Republicans over his racial invective. He’s also "
    "been suspended from Facebook and banished from Native American lands in his district as he contests charges of "
    "breaking into the Capitol grounds and disrupting Congress that could carry a one-year sentence. A recall effort "
    "is underway, amid a bevy of lawsuits.  Still, loyal constituents are easy to come by in a rural county steeped "
    "in the anti-establishment, pro-gun culture that dominates southern New Mexico.  “He means no malice on anybody,"
    "” said George Seeds, outside the New Heart Cowboy Church in Alamogordo where Griffin once served as pastor. “His "
    "concern is the direction of this country, where it’s going.”  Defiance of federal government and its oversight "
    "of public lands are staples of politics in Otero County, which spans an area three times the size of Delaware, "
    "from the dunes of White Sands National Park to the peaks of the Lincoln National Forest.  Banned from Washington "
    "until testimony or trial, Griffin has returned to the routines of home in a tidy double-wide trailer in "
    "Tularosa, working most days as a stone mason. A donkey named Henry brays from a side yard.  In a conversation "
    "with The Associated Press, Griffin says he learned to love the spotlight during five years as an expert rodeo "
    "hand in a Wild West show at Paris’ Disneyland park.  His rides with Cowboys for Trump through numerous states "
    "were a reprise of proselytizing trips he made from Ireland to Jerusalem, before social media, to hand out the "
    "Gospel of John.  The group captivated the public imagination with its first outing, a 2019 flag-waving ride down "
    "the shore of the Potomac River to Arlington National Cemetery.  Ramie Harper, a 67-year-old former bull rider "
    "from Fruitland, took a break from making custom hats to join the caravan.  “They loved it,” Harper said. “We was "
    "on ‘Fox & Friends’ the next day.”  With calls for an independent investigation of the Capitol siege blocked by "
    "Senate Republicans, Griffin is out on bail and speaking his mind.  He’s an advocate for stricter state voting "
    "laws and a die-hard opponent of COVID-19 restrictions who says “hell no” to taking the vaccine.  Griffin still "
    "wears a monogrammed Cowboys for Trump shirt to commission meetings. But his allegiance to Trump has wavered.  “I "
    "don’t have the same confidence in him,” Griffin said. “Whenever you say, ‘China stole the election. ... The "
    "election was stolen from me,’ and then you just walk away? That’s hard for me to accept.”  He says his obsession "
    "with politics has taken a toll, contributing to his 2019 divorce and tensions with relatives.  “I’ve had my own "
    "family say some pretty nasty things,” Griffin said. “It’s been real hard.”  With Trump or without, Griffin still "
    "ascribes to unsubstantiated claims of massive 2020 election fraud.  He yearns to someday run for governor even "
    "though state GOP leaders are openly scornful and Democrats hold every statewide elected office.  More "
    "immediately, Griffin is eyeing an open 2022 sheriff’s race in another New Mexico county where he grew up. His "
    "grandfather Wee Griffin held the Catron County post from 1963 to 1966. Trump won there in 2020 with 73% of the "
    "vote.  Griffin has cast Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham as his political nemesis on issues of gun "
    "control, abortion and pandemic restrictions. He’d like to reinvent the sheriff’s role as a brake on the "
    "governor’s power.  “The county sheriff’s sole duty and responsibility is to protect our individual rights,"
    "” he said. “You think that the governor hates me as a county commissioner — put a gun and a badge on me, "
    "and we’ll see.”  Jeff Swanson, chairman of the Otero County Democratic Party, says Griffin’s divisive remarks "
    "hinder county efforts to secure state infrastructure spending, and he has engaged in intimidation by recording "
    "Cowboys for Trump videos from his office with a shotgun within view.  In Alamogordo, Griffin’s rhetoric on race "
    "has steeled the determination of opponents who want him out of office.  Griffin delivered a scathing rebuke last "
    "year as the NFL announced game-opening renditions of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” also known as the Black "
    "national anthem.  “They want to destroy our country,” Griffin said in a video monologue. “I got a better idea. "
    "Why don’t you go back to Africa and form your little football teams. ... You can play on an old beat-out dirt "
    "lot.”  Everette Brown, a Marine veteran and information technology specialist at Holloman Air Force Base who is "
    "Black, said that comment shows politics have changed Griffin, whom he once respected.  “I’m a big boy. I can "
    "handle a lot. And that was one that got me,” said Brown, part of a committee seeking to recall Griffin.  For "
    "now, Griffin has halted the petition with an appeal to the state Supreme Court, which hasn’t decided whether to "
    "intervene. Meanwhile, state prosecutors are investigating allegations Griffin used his office in coordination "
    "with Cowboys for Trump for personal financial gain, and signed a child-support check to his ex-wife from his "
    "Cowboys for Trump account.  Griffin has acknowledged using the county building for promotional videos but said "
    "he never claimed they were affiliated with Otero County. He also says Cowboys for Trump is a for-profit company, "
    "not a political group.  Donnie Reynolds, a 51-year-old sales associate at an Alamogordo hardware store, "
    "says Griffin is being targeted for ties to Trump.  He says Griffin is right about lots of things, like the need "
    "for a border wall.  “They’re going find out he didn’t have anything to do with these types of things,” he said. "
    "“They’re going to eat some crow.” ",
    "Phil Mickelson now has played 30 times in the U.S. Open and he only has a silver medal — six of them — to show "
    "for it.  His week at Torrey Pines ended with a 40 on the back nine for a closing 75, putting him at 11-over 295 "
    "for the week. Since the last of his six runner-up finishes at Merion in 2013, he has either missed the cut or "
    "finished over par in the U.S. Open.  At least he gets more chances. By winning the PGA Championship last month, "

    "CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia’s suppression of information seen as pivotal to a free and open media is at "
    "the center of accusations that the country has become one of the world’s most secretive democracies.  Last week, "
    "a former Australian spy was convicted over his unconfirmed role as a whistleblower who revealed an espionage "
    "operation against the government of East Timor.  It’s the latest high-profile case in a national system in which "
    "secrecy laws, some dating back to the colonial era, are routinely used to suppress information. Police have also "
    "threatened to charge journalists who exposed war crime allegations against Australian special forces in "
    "Afghanistan, or bureaucrats’ plan to allow an intelligence agency to spy on Australian citizens.  Australians "
    "don’t even know the name of the former spy convicted Friday. The Canberra court registry listed him as “Witness "
    "K.” His lawyer referred to him more respectfully as “Mr. K” in court.  K spent the two-day hearing in a box "
    "constructed from black screens to hide his identity. The public and media were sent out of the courtroom when "
    "classified evidence was discussed, which was about half the time.  The only sign that anyone was actually inside "
    "the box was when a voice said “guilty” after K was asked how he pleaded.  The Australian government has refused "
    "to comment on allegations that K led an Australian Secret Intelligence Service operation that bugged government "
    "offices in the East Timorese capital in 2004, during negotiations on the sharing of oil and gas revenue from the "
    "seabed that separates the two countries.  The government canceled K’s passport before he was to testify at the "
    "Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in 2014 in support of the East Timorese, who argued the treaty was "
    "invalid because Australia failed to negotiate in good faith by engaging in espionage.  There was no evidence "
    "heard in open court of a bugging operation, which media reported was conducted under the guise of a foreign aid "
    "program.  K was given a three-month suspended sentence. If he’d been sent to prison, there were court orders "
    "designed to conceal his former espionage career by restricting what he could tell friends and associates to "
    "explain his predicament.  He had faced up to two years in prison. Since his offense, Australia has continued to "
    "tighten controls on secrecy, increasing the maximum sentence to 10 years.  As lacking in transparency as K’s "
    "prosecution was, it was a vast improvement on Australia’s treatment of another rogue intelligence officer known "
    "as Witness J.  J has been described by the media as possibly the only person in Australian history to be tried, "
    "sentenced and imprisoned in secret. But no one seems to know for sure.  As with K, it is illegal to reveal J’s "
    "identity.  J pleaded guilty in a closed courtroom in the same Canberra court complex in 2018 to charges related "
    "to mishandling classified information and potentially revealing the identities of Australian agents. He spent 15 "
    "months in prison.  The secret court hearing and imprisonment only became public in late 2019 because J took "
    "court action against the Australian Capital Territory government, claiming his human rights were violated by "
    "police who raided his prison cell in search of a memoir he was writing.  Outraged lawyers then called for the "
    "first major review of the nation’s secrecy laws since 2010. Whistleblowers as well as journalists currently are "
    "under threat from more than 70 counterterrorism and security laws passed by Parliament since the 9/11 attacks in "
    "the U.S.  Andrew Wilkie, a former government intelligence analyst whistleblower who’s now an independent federal "
    "lawmaker, is a vocal critic of national security being used as an excuse to pander to paranoia and shield "
    "embarrassment.  Wilkie opposed the prosecution of K and his former lawyer Bernard Collaery. Collaery is fighting "
    "a charge that he conspired with K to reveal secrets to East Timor, and wants his trial to be open.  “I am in no "
    "doubt that one of the reasons for the secrecy around the K and Collaery matter is the enormous political "
    "embarrassment that we were spying on one of the poorest countries in the world to get an upper hand in a "
    "business negotiation,” Wilkie said.  Wilkie quit his intelligence job in the Office of National Assessments days "
    "before Australian troops joined U.S. and British forces in the 2003 Iraq invasion. He publicly argued that Iraq "
    "didn’t pose sufficient threat to warrant invasion and that there was no evidence linking Iraq’s government to "
    "al-Qaida.  “I basically accused the government of lying,” Wilkie said.  Although the government attempted to "
    "discredit him, Wilkie said he was never threatened with prosecution for revealing classified information.  For "
    "many, Australian authorities took a step too far in June 2019 in their bid to chase down whistleblowers, "
    "intimidate journalists and protect government secrets.  Police raided the home of News Corp. journalist Annika "
    "Smethurst, and the next day the headquarters of the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Both media outlets had used "
    "leaked government documents as the basis of public interest journalism.  The search warrants were issued under "
    "Section 70 of the Crimes Act 1914, which prohibited a government employee from sharing information without a "
    "supervisor’s permission.  That section has since been replaced under national security legislation that expanded "
    "the crime to include a government employee sharing opinions or reporting conversations between others.  Media "
    "law experts Johan Lidberg and Denis Muller said Australia is the only country within the Five Eyes "
    "intelligence-sharing alliance – which includes the United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand – that gives "
    "its security agencies the power to issue search warrants against journalists in the hunt for public interest "
    "whistleblowers in the name of national security.  Police decided in May last year that they had insufficient "
    "evidence to charge Smethurst, the journalist, over an article published in April 2018. She had reported that two "
    "government department bosses planned to create new espionage powers that would allow an intelligence agency to "
    "legally spy on Australian citizens.  Prosecutors also decided in October last year that the “public interest "
    "does not require a prosecution” of ABC reporter Dan Oakes over a television investigation broadcast in July 2017 "
    "that alleged Australian troops killed unarmed men and children in Afghanistan in potential war crimes.  But "
    "David McBride, a former Australian army lawyer who admits leaking classified documents to the ABC, is fighting "
    "multiple charges. He calculates he faces up to 50 years in prison for being a whistleblower.  There have been "
    "two parliamentary inquiries into press freedom since the police raids, but progress toward change has been "
    "criticized as slow and weak.  The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which has "
    "rubber-stamped many of the problem security laws, said many submissions for change warned that “the balance in "
    "legislation and culture within the Australian government has tipped away from transparency and engagement to "
    "excessive and unnecessary secrecy.”  A Senate committee inquiry into press freedom last month made several "
    "recommendations, mostly for more government investigation. The committee asked whether secret information "
    "offenses should be amended to include a harm requirement, and whether journalists should still have to prove "
    "that an unauthorized disclosure was in the public interest.  Wilkie, the lawmaker, argues Australia has drifted "
    "into becoming a “pre-police state” through its embrace of secrecy.  “It’s now unremarkable when a government "
    "cloaks something in a national security need for secrecy,” Wilkie said. “We don’t bat an eyelid anymore. We "
