    "complaint says that Leopold appealed the FBI s response but was denied by the U.S. Department of Justice Office "
    "of Information in 2013. In its appeal decision, OIP claimed that the FBI is not required to perform "
    "cross-reference searches unless the requester provides  information sufficient to enable the FBI to determine "
    "with certainty that any cross-references it locates are identifiable to the subject of [the] request,  "

    "'US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan Photo: AFP US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan threatened both China and Russia during his interviews with different media on Sunday. For Russia, he claimed that the US is preparing another package of sanctions in the case of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. This has shocked many peoples expectations of US-Russia relations after the two leaders summit. Sullivan also took a coercive tone to request China to cooperate with the further investigation into the origins of COVID-19; otherwise, China will face isolation in the international community. The US will not simply accept China saying no, he said.Sullivan has shown typical American arrogance of calling white black. Perhaps he and his colleagues think that the US strength can support them to do whatever they want, and they may believe the recent summits held by Western countries prove that the US still maintains the mobilization power to arbitrarily isolate a large country like China. When targeting China in his interview on Sunday, he used the phrase from that position of strength.The US is indeed the strongest country in the world. But the US ruling elites have seriously overestimated the international coercive force its national strength can produce. The US is still struggling with the Korean Peninsula and Iran issues, and the Afghanistan and Iraq wars it initiated have ended in chaos. Over the past one or two decades, the US has failed to do anything neatly and cleanly. When Sullivan confidently threatened China and Russia, his gestures were as hilarious as a bad boy in an elementary school class.China and Russia will undoubtedly refute Sullivan strongly. If Sullivan has normal self-esteem, he should feel a wind relentlessly blowing his spittle back to his own face.China will not accept any investigation by US intelligence agencies. If we find any trace of US intelligence agencies taking action in China, we will immediately strike heavily. The US does not have the final say on the origins tracing conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO). It must be carried out according to normal procedures. WHO experts have already conducted investigation in China and made their conclusion. The tracing of the COVID-19 origins needs to be done in multiple places in the world, including the US. This order of investigation cannot be changed by the US alone.Navalny serving jail sentence is Russia\'s domestic affair. The more the US intervenes in it, the more clearly it shows that this is beyond Washington\'s ability. On the one hand, the US intends to ease relations with Russia. On the other hand, it wants to bluff over the Navalny issue. When the US\' self-contradiction collides with Russias firm attitude of sticking to its principles, Washington will never take any advantage from it.The US\' advantage in strength cannot support the reckless display of its bad attitude toward China and Russia. The US cannot do anything to China and Russia, and this is the reality that the world can see and understand. The Trump administration made its efforts for years to weaken Beijing and Moscow, and it failed. Now the Biden administration has even fewer resources to flaunt its superiority. It wants to unite its allies to contain China and Russia, but it is ridiculous that it thinks this will have any strategic effect.What most European allies can contribute to the US is hollow words. They will never offer real benefits. The US wants to use the alliance system of the Cold War era to support a different kind of competition in the era of globalization - this is just like the US needs to build walls but the tool it finds is a cotton machine. China and Russia are not afraid of Washington\'s new attempt of roping in allies. On the contrary, every move between China and Russia to further strengthen strategic cooperation can frighten many US and Western elites.The arrogant US ruling elites should curtail their arrogance. China and Russia will not take the initiative in provoking the US and its allies, but if they encounter new serious provocations, the two countries\' counterattack will be determined and immediate. In addition, we need to remind the US that it does not own UN agencies such as the WHO, nor can the West represent the international community. Washington needs to have more sense of shame and have a clearer estimation of itself.'"
    "Children play in a lavender farm in Huocheng County, northwest Chinas Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, June 13, 2021. (Photo: Xinhua)nnRecently, Northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region released data on its population based on the seventh national population census. This data, however, has drawn the attention of some Western media and so-called “scholars,” and the reason is very simple – they want to get “evidence” from this data to back up the allegations of “genocide” they have been making against China.In fact, the statistics released by the Xinjiang region showed that the population of the Uygur ethnic group has increased by 1.623 million in the past decade, a rate of increase of 16.2 percent.It fully demonstrated there is no “genocide” in the region. However, despite these facts, a group of people are attempting to misinterpret the data, trying to piece up “evidence” that may support the “genocide” allegation. They have now come up with a new concept of “slow genocide.”This move has made genocide – a very serious crime – sound entertaining. Genocide that can be proved to be genocide should still be called genocide, but “genocide” that can never be proven has now been called “slow genocide.” It sounds more like a typical set-up of public opinion with the purpose of forcibly imposing the crime of “genocide” on China.Those who invented the phrase “slow genocide” do not care about whether this crime can be “proven” or when on earth it could be “slowly proven.” They only care about how to play word games to legitimize the groundless allegation and to bind China’s Xinjiang tightly with the word “genocide” in rolling coverage by Western media. During this process, their occasional moves of creating more words that have no basis on logic or laws are only seen as “necessary” technical fixing.Apart from the “genocide” allegation that a certain group of people want to cram into people’s minds, the data on Xinjiang’s population has attracted their attention for a deeper reason. After the malicious theory of a decrease in the Uygur population was proven wrong, another accusation that the Han population has increased in Xinjiang has surfaced.This theory has been made under a narrative framework that says Uygur and Han people are on opposite sides and the Xinjiang region is not China’s Xinjiang but Uygurs’ Xinjiang. Only under this binary opposition narrative pattern can they distort the concept of natural population mobility into a negative one of “occupation.” As a region of China, Xinjiang has attracted people from other parts of the country now that terrorism in the region has been stamped out. What is wrong with this natural population mobility within China?Meanwhile, people may ask another question – is it “legitimate” for Uygurs to move to other parts of China from the Xinjiang region? People who subscribe to the binary opposition narrative pattern have already prepared their answer – they call this China’s evil strategy of trying to “assimilate” Uygurs.The above-mentioned people do not care that population mobility has brought development opportunities to Xinjiang, nor will they accept Uygur people’s willingness to move to other places for better development, since none of these fit their logic. According to their narrative, Xinjiang can only be a place where “no one should come or go.”Statistics, as a science, involves complicated methodology and formulas. The statistical results that the public has access to are mainly compiled from general and sampling surveys. General surveys need to be carried out to acquire every individual’s information to the greatest extent possible. A sampling survey is more like a calculation – it can be made based on having part of the information.Carrying out the two kinds of surveys requires different numbers of people and resources to be mobilized and requires different lengths of time, and therefore the accuracy of the results cannot be compared. For statistical purposes, data acquired from the general survey and sampling survey are necessarily different. This is simple and clear common sense.After Xinjiang released its population data, some Western media and so-called experts seemed “encouraged,” and put the ridiculous “genocide” allegation into the data to get proof. In order to reach the predetermined conclusion, they even randomly selected different statistical data obtained from different methodologies to make comparisons – a move that is like firing the arrow and then drawing the target.A sentence used by Chinese netizens can be used to describe such behavior – they are either foolish or malicious.Zhang Nan is a research fellow from China Society for Human Rights Studies."
    "US President Joe Biden (right) and South Korean President Moon Jae-in participate in a press conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC on May 21. Photo: VCGnnThe Korean Peninsula situation is at a crossroad and more efforts should be made to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula and resume dialogues, Chinese experts said amid the visit of a veteran US official to South Korea on nuclear talks.Chinese experts believe positive results are expected from the visit as the Biden administration has worked to formulate a new approach on North Korea that is believed to be more flexible and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un signaled willingness to have talks.Sung Kim, US special envoy for North Korea, arrived in Seoul on Saturday and will have talks with Noh Kyu-duk, South Koreas special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs on Monday.On the same day, the two along with Takehiro Funakoshi, head of the Japanese Foreign Ministrys Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau will have a trilateral meeting on nuclear talks, according to the Japan Times. This is his first visit to South Korea since being appointed to the post.Later on Tuesday, Sung Kim will meet with Seouls Unification Minister Lee In-young and members of academia and civil society to discuss the outcome of Washingtons North Korean policy review before leaving the country on Wednesday, KBS reported on Saturday.Sung Kims five-day visit to South Korea comes as the administration of US President Joe Biden has finished a review of its policy on North Korea in April and North Korea made gestures for the first time since Biden took office that it is willing to resume nuclear talks, according to media reports.This trilateral meeting is part of the Biden administrations broader plan of coordinating with every possible nation to reach the goal of complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Sunday.Contrary to the Trump administrations strategy of fighting alone, the Biden administration is willing to coordinate with its allies and countries including the European Union, NATO, Russia and China or use the coordination mechanism under the UN framework to solve the issue, Yang said.Kim Jong-un and Trump met three times in 2018 and 2019, but failed to reach any tangible result in denuclearization in the Korean Peninsula.Different from the Trump administration on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the Biden administration is taking a more flexible strategy - while it imposes high pressure against North Korea, it will adjust its policies in accordance with North Korean moves. If North Korea goes soft on issues on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the US would go softer; if North Korea gets tough, the US will go tougher, Yang said.The Korean Peninsula situation is at a crossroad as the Biden administration has worked to formulate a new approach on North Korea and Kim Jong-un is adjusting his policy in dealing with the US, Yang said.Days earlier, Kim Jong-un said that North Korea will prepare for both diplomacy and confrontation with the US during the Third Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Workers Party of Korea (WPK) on Thursday, which was widely interpreted as a sign of North Koreas willingness to resume nuclear talks after Biden took office.To safeguard national dignity and the interests of independent development, and a peaceful environment and national security, Kim Jong-un said North Korea must be prepared for both dialogue and confrontation, according to the Korean Central News Agency.Yang said Kim Jong-uns comments represent a shift from previous total refusals to participate in any talks to one of diplomacy and confrontation, indicating that North Korea is open to dialogue with the Biden administration.The meeting outlined a principle that North Korea is dedicated to breaking its political isolation and lifting itself out of economic sanctions, especially when North Korea domestically has sealed itself off since the COVID-19 epidemic began, Lü Chao, a research fellow at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday.The attitude shift means North Korea is open to tentative contact with the US and is eyeing efforts by the US to resume talks, but no sign is showing the country is anywhere close to accepting complete denuclearization, Lü said.In May, Biden admitted that he was under no illusions about the difficulty of getting North Korea to give up its nuclear arsenal after his predecessors failed.Biden said he and South Korean President Moon Jae-in shared a willingness to engage diplomatically with North Korea and to take pragmatic steps to alleviate tensions, according to Reuters.Chinese experts noted that military drills between the US and South Korea this August will be a critical moment to watch for possible signs of easing regional tension and a step closer to resumption of US-North Korea talks. The atmosphere inevitably becomes more tense at these times.As a Korean American, Sung Kim was a long-time US representative for the Six-Party Talks, so he could be said to be a connoisseur in Peninsula issues. The Biden administration is hopeful about the breakthrough that Sung Kim will bring for the goal of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, Lü said.Positive results are expected during Sung Kims visit. Sung Kim is likely to discuss with the US plans for North Korea with South Korea and Japan and ask coordination from the two countries. Given the common stance that South Korea, Japan and the US share, coordination on North Korea issues would be easy to reach, Chinese experts said.Yang believes that the resumption of US-North Korea talks would not be difficult given the Biden administrations flexibility and an attitude shift from North Korea, but keeping the dialogue on track and preventing it from stalling as happened in the past will be challenging.For China, Lü noted that it hopes that Sung Kim would use his considerable expertise in dealing with Peninsula issues to arrive at new approaches to make contact with North Korea, such as expanding the US-North Korea talks to the four sides or six sides talking mechanism, or resume the Six-Party Talks.Talks participated in by multiple countries such as China, Russia or Japan could play a positive role in coordinating, mediating and prompting talks, Lü said.A multi-party mechanism might be a good way to break the deadlock in the US-North Korea talks, which has been stalled since 2019, Lü said."
    "Visitors take photos of soil samples from moon retrieved by the Change-5 lunar lander in December 2020, which went on display at the National Museum of China in Beijing on Sunday. Scientific and technological objects related to the lunar exploration project are also on display at the exhibition. Photo: Li Hao/GTnnEvents explaining Chinas aerospace development, including an exhibition of lunar soil brought back by the Change-5 lunar probe from its epic trip last December, are expected to be put on show in Hong Kong this week. The event will boost locals patriotic sentiment and spur Hong Kong researchers to become involved in the countrys scientific advance, local university professors told the Global Times on Monday.Samples of the lunar soil that were retrieved from Chinas first extraterrestrial sample-collecting mission were due to arrive in Hong Kong on Monday, local media hk01.com reported, and they will be put on display at an exhibition center from June 27 until July. A smaller version of the Change-5 lunar probe prototype will also be shown to the public.Tang Fei, principal of the Heung To Secondary School (Tseung Kwan O) in Hong Kong, confirmed to the Global Times that he had received an important notice about the exhibition from the local education bureau.A group of chief designers of various national space projects will visit Hong Kong campuses this week, exchanging views and sharing their experience in Chinas aerospace development with local students, according to a notice released by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University on Monday.Among the visiting experts are the countrys first chief designer of the Shenzhou manned spacecraft Qi Faren, and deputy chief designer of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System Xie Jun, who will be speaking at the university on Wednesday and Thursday.As the only research institute in Hong Kong that has taken part in the work of the Change-5 mission , professor Yung Kai-leung and his team played a vital role in the collection of lunar samples, by developing an automatic surface sampling and packing system that collects, packs and seals soil samples from the lunar surface.Chan Wai-keung, a lecturer at the universitys division of social sciences, told the Global Times on Monday that it would be beneficial for local residents to arouse their patriotic sentiment through Chinas achievements in aerospace.It reminded me of the time when the first Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei paid a visit to Hong Kong in 2003, triggering overwhelming cheers as people regarded him as their superstar, Chan said.He added that Hong Kong should cherish the countrys decision to bring such precious items to Hong Kong for exhibition, which will encourage more Hong Kong scientists to participate in the countrys scientific projects and engage in academic exchanges with the Chinese mainland.Zhou Jianping, the chief designer of Chinas manned space engineering project, said on Thursday during media interview that he will definitely include astronauts from Hong Kong in the countrys future manned space activities, adding that he had been well-prepared for the selection of candidates in the region.He noted that while Hong Kong astronauts cannot be taken aboard during the space stations construction, given the tasks complexity, they will be included in future missions to the station.Pei Zhaoyu, a deputy director of the Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center of the China National Space Administration, expressed similar willingness, as he welcomed Hong Kong scientists to participate in the research and study of the lunar soil collected by Change-5 ahead of the missions successful return, local media reported.The Shenzhou-12 crew of three astronauts - Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo - is also expected to visit Hong Kong in early October, according to local media hk01.com, after they return to Earth following a three-month stay in Chinas Tianhe space station core module.Its a much-anticipated journey as China sends its first batch of residents into space, marking yet another milestone in the countrys aerospace program.In Chinas first bold quest to retrieve material from an extraterrestrial body and return it to Earth, the Change-5 lunar probe embarked on an epic journey on November 24, 2020 after it was launched from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in South Chinas Hainan Province.Some 23 days later, the 11-stage mission was drawn to a perfect conclusion as the re-entry capsule, carrying with it a precious parcel of lunar soil weighing about two kilograms, landed safely in North Chinas Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on December 17, 2020.The mission made China the third country to have successfully brought lunar materials back to Earth, after the US and the former Soviet Union.Regarded as one of the most complex and challenging explorations in Chinas aerospace history, the Change-5 mission recorded many firsts in the countrys space development, including the first-ever takeoff from the lunar surface, first lunar sample retrieval, and the first rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit.It also achieved multiple technological breakthroughs that laid a solid foundation for future manned mission to Moon and other deep-space projects."
    "Schools in the UK have been told by a cross-party committee of MPs that promoting the notion of “white privilege” could breach equality laws while also harming disadvantaged white students.nnThe committee report found that despite the relentless narrative that “white privilege” is holding back non-white students, white students are actually underperforming.nn“In 2019, 17.7 per cent of free school meal eligible white British pupils achieved grade 5 or above in English and maths, compared with 22.5 per cent of all FSM-eligible pupils,” reports Schoolsweek.nnThe report notes that disadvantaged white children do not have “white privilege,” with MPs “(concerned) about the impact that hearing terms like that presented as fact will have on those children.”nnDifferent language must be used when discussing racial disparities in order “to ensure that young people are not inadvertently being inducted into political movements,” states the report.nnThe MPs “hope that by highlighting the hardships faced by many white people from disadvantaged backgrounds” their recommendations “may help advance a new way to discuss disadvantage without pitting different groups against each other.”nnThe report also notes that using terms such as “white privilege” could be a violation of the Equality Act 2010 and only serves to increase racial tension by pitting groups against each other.nn“Disadvantaged White children feel anything but privileged when it comes to education,” said Conservative MP, Robert Halfon, adding that there was a desperate need to move away from obsessing over “white privilege” when for most white students, it doesn’t exist.nnEducation systems in Europe and America are riddled with the cancer that is Critical Race Theory as well as attempts to “decolonise” curriculums, which is a euphemism for making white people feel ashamed of their history.nnDespite the fact that “diversity and inclusion” extremists have largely hijacked the education system and weaponized it against white students, the ludicrous narrative that “systemic racism” only impacts non-whites still persists.nnIndeed, the only form of acceptable “systemic racism” that still exists in the western world is practiced against white people."

He was just trying to ensure nobody made a mistake that could be offensive,” one source told The Mail.nnThe school responded to the issue by immediately launching a full on groveling apology campaign and insisting that it dutifully indoctrinates students with “diversity” narratives.nn“As part of our commitment to British values and spiritual, moral, social and cultural development, each half term sees a focus on a key issue relating to diversity: gender, LGBTI, immigration, race, different needs (including mental health and being differently abled) and religion,” states the school’s website.nnSchool authorities also sent a letter to parents making it clear that the curriculum had been “decolonised,” meaning British history is being taught as something to be ashamed of.nn“We understand that racism is systemic and that, like all institutions, we are far from immune to it,” said the letter, furthering the myth that “systemic racism” exists in any other form that the only actual form left, which is systemic discrimination against white people.nnMeanwhile, LGBT lobby group Stonewall is now insisting that teachers in UK schools avoid using the words “boy” and “girl” and instead refer to students as “learners”.nnThe next generation of adults is shaping up to be a collection of bed-wetting imbeciles who hate themselves, hate their own country and think that “offensive” words are one of society’s biggest problems."
    "On June 12, Missouri Governor Mike Parson signed HB 85, the “Second Amendment Preservation Act” recently approved by the state’s legislature.nnThe new law is designed to prevent state and local law enforcement from enforcing federal laws regulating private ownership of firearms.nnThe actnnDeclares that all federal acts, laws, executive orders, administrative orders, court orders, rules, and regulations, whether past, present, or future, that infringe on the people’s right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 23 of the Missouri Constitution must be invalid in this state, including those that impose a tax, levy, fee, or stamp on these items as specified in the bill; require the registration or tracking of these items or their owners; prohibit the possession, ownership, use, or transfer of a firearm; or order the confiscation of these itemsnnMoreover, the act opens up law enforcement officials and other state personnel to legal penalties if they do enforce federal firearms laws andnnSpecifies that any entity or person who knowingly acts under the color of any federal or state law to deprive a Missouri citizen of the rights or privileges ensured by the federal and state constitutions to keep and bear arms must be liable to the injured party for redress, including monetary damages in the amount of $50,000 per occurrence and injunctive relief. … Sovereign immunity shall not be a defense.nnBasically, the law attempts to do two different things. The first is to declare certain federal laws invalid within the state.nnThe second is to state that police are prohibited from providing “material aid and support” to federal officials seeking to prosecute Missouri residents under federal gun laws.nnThe first aspect of the legislation is on shaky ground. The second aspect, however, has the potential to have a real effect on the enforcement of federal gun laws in the state.nnStates Can’t Invalidate Federal Laws, But They Don’t Have to Help Enforce ThemnnNaturally, gun control advocates and opponents of decentralization have condemned the bill, mostly on grounds of the legal doctrines and federal preemption and federal supremacy.nnBut this only applies to the part of the bill claiming to invalidate federal law. National Public Radio, for instance quotes law professor Stephen Vladeck who states: “If I am a resident of Missouri, I am no less subject to federal gun laws today than [before the law was passed].”nnThis is true enough in the strict legal sense. Federal gun laws have not actually been repealed in Missouri, and the federal government can still draw upon its own resources to attempt to enforce these laws within the state.nnOn the other hand, by directing state officials to not enforce federal laws in the state the new act makes it more difficult to enforce federal law and deprives the federal government of resources it has long assumed it could call upon whenever it wanted. After all, the federal government has long regarded state and local police as “valuable partners” who act as informants and who provide personnel, firepower, jails, and other amenities that make it easier to federal officials to arrest and prosecute locals.nnIf the new Missouri legislation truly leads to a situation in which federal officials can’t count on any state or local manpower, this will mean a de facto decline in the ability of federal officials to enforce federal law in the state.nnThis is not unprecedented. During the 1850s, for example, state government passed laws prohibiting state officials from assisting federal agents who sought to enforce the federal fugitive slave acts.nnThe Lessons We Learned from State Marijuana LegalizationnnBut there is a much more recent example that we can look to to better understand Missouri’s new law.nnWe have seen this tactic at work already in the realm of federal marijuana laws.nnFor example, when Colorado voters approved Amendment 64, which legalized recreational marijuana in the state, the result, in practice, was something similar to what Missouri is attempting.nnAmendment 64 declared marijuana to be legal in the state under a broad variety of circumstances, and the text of the amendment simply stated that marijuana would be legal for people in Colorado over 21 years of age.nnThis invalidated state and local laws outlawing marijuana. Of course, marijuana continued to be illegal under federal law, and federal officials were free to enter the state and prosecute business owners and individuals who owned, bought, and sold marijuana.nnAnd yet, this rarely happened. There were some efforts—and numerous threats—by federal officials to “crack down” on locals in Colorado, but these efforts proved to be anemic.nnIt should be noted that the Colorado amendment (and enacting legislation) was in fact much more mild than the Missouri legislation. The amendment did not explicitly prohibit state officials from cooperating with federal officials. But the result in practice was similar. State and local law enforcement backed off substantially from all enforcement efforts, and federal law came to be seen as an alien force working contrary to the interests of policymakers of both parties. Colorado members of Congress (from both parties) introduced and supported legislation seeking to limiting federal enforcement of marijuana laws in Colorado or in other states that had legalized its use and possession.nnMoreover, when it was thought that the Trump administration might finally “crack down” on Coloradans using marijuana, state legislators did introduce legislation specifically prohibiting state officials from cooperating with federal officials in “Arresting a Colorado citizen or person lawfully present in Colorado for committing an act in Colorado that is a Colorado constitutional right.” (This legislation passed the House but failed in the Senate).nnToday, federal marijuana prohibitions and enforcement in Colorado has been significantly limited and scaled back.nnPublic Opinion MattersnnPart of the reason marijuana legalization at the state level has worked so well in pushing back against federal law is that public opinion is on the side of legalization. As more and more states moved to legalization marijuana, it became clear that the public in general and many members of Congress had little interest in really pressing the issue.nnThat is, cracking down on marijuana users apparently just didn’t have much of a national support base. Congress and the White House have been unwilling to legalize marijuana, but they have also apparently also been unwilling to push the issue.nnState-level moves to legalize marijuana have not made federal law “invalid” in any de jure sense. But they have gone a long way toward doing so in practice.nnCan Opponents of Federal Gun Laws Copy the Colorado Strategy?nnCan Missouri succeed in the way efforts to legalize marijuana have succeeded through state legalization?nnThis will depend on both public opinion and the willingness of other state governments to join in.nnOther states must take similar steps just as other states joined Colorado. As Alaska, California, Washington, Massachusetts, and other states joined Colorado in legalizing marijuana, this made it all the more clear to federal law enforcement agencies that they shouldn’t expect a groundswell of support should they decide to show the state governments who’s boss.nnOnly after several states—ideally including politically powerful states like Florida and Texas—start to line up on the side of state autonomy in gun legislation will we know if there is enough political will to cripple federal enforcement as has happened with marijuana.nnIn other words, state-level efforts to end federal enforcement within their borders are as much a political effort as they are a legal one. Legal scholars can talk about the supremacy clause and federal preemption until they’re blue in the face, but its political trends and public opinion that will ultimately decide the outcome.nnBecause public opinion in so many states has been trending in the direction of marijuana legalization, neither the federal courts nor the White House have been willing to press the issue of forcing federal “supremacy.”nnAnother lesson of the Colorado marijuana strategy is this: meaningful reform began at the state level and indirectly forced the hand of federal officials. It was only after states began saying “we’re not going to do what the federal government wants” that Congress and federal agencies began to lose their nerve to force these federal regulations on states. In other words, the political strategy of effectively ignoring and essentially nullifying federal marijuana laws has clearly been effective. Whether or not opponents of federal gun laws can find similar success with this strategy remains to be seen."

Smaller men will now have a quality product to help them “overcomb their fear of pregnancy and STD’s” while still delivering “the highest sensitivity” the condom market has ever seen.nn[adsforwp id=70836] Trump Admin to Deregulate Pressure of Golden Showers[] <Washington, DC>According to multiple inside sources with absolutely no knowledge of the subject, the Trump Administration is looking to rollback a 1992 law regulating the pressure of golden showers to more than 2.5 gallons of urine per minute. The sudden change follows complaints from President Trump about his hair routine.  “So golden showers – you take a golden shower, the urine doesn’t come out. You want to wash your hands, the urine doesn’t come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a golden shower longer? Because my hair – I don’t know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect,” Trump probably said.  In a soon to be released tell-all by Trumps former fixer/attorney, Michael Cohen, Cohen confirms Trumps affinity to the golden shower stating “From golden showers in a sex club in Vegas, to tax fraud, to deals with corrupt officials from the former Soviet Union, to catch and kill conspiracies to silence Trump’s clandestine lovers, I wasn’t just a witness to the president’s rise—I was an active and eager participant.”  Consumer and urine conservation groups argue such changes are wasteful and unnecessary.  Bill Samuals, executive director of the urine conservation group Urine Awareness Project, called the proposal “silly,” adding “you could have 2 or 3 ladies pissing on your face at once pushing out 8-10 gallons of urine per minute, seems excessive.”  “If the president needs help finding a good golden shower, we can point him to some great websites that help you identify ladies with a heavier flow that would provide a dense soak and a good golden shower,” he added.  [adsforwp id=70836] ‘Wounded Social Justice Warrior Project’ Rebuilds Hope; Sense of Purpose[] Prudence Bradley, 19, found it difficult to put into words what she experienced during her days as a social justice warrior. She didn’t have to. The way the slightly overweight feminist apologetically paused, fought back tears, and forced out a simple, “Stuff happened there,” told the story of the pain she’s been carrying since she first started fighting for gender equality almost two years ago.  Bradley’s troubles reached an apex the day she organized an anti-Donald Trump rally in Lubbock, Texas. Prudence and a group of fellow UW-M students made the long trek from Madison, WI, to protest Trump’s treatment of women in the Lone Star State.  Almost an hour into their protest, a man wearing a Make America Great Again hat and confederate flag suspenders approached her and screamed “feminazi f*ck pig” right to her face. For Mrs. Bradley, it was like being shot point blank in the face with a high-capacity assault weapon.  “I was in a state of total shock,” said Bradley, “I couldn’t feel my legs and thought I may have been paralyzed.” After being treated at a local medical facility for minor emotional distress, Prudence caught the first flight back home to seek a second opinion.  “Prudence was showing all the classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD,” said Dr. Liam Williams, Bradley’s family doctor in Madison. “Re-experiencing the trauma through intrusive and distressing recollections of the event, flashbacks, and nightmares are just some of Mrs. Bradley’s symptoms,” warned the doctor. “Prudence was also showing extreme emotional numbness that puts her in a very dangerous category of PTSD. It’s very important she start a treatment program immediately.”  The Bradley family researched treatment facilities across the country, hoping to find a program that would give their daughter the best overall chance at a full recovery. After almost a month of searching, the family were losing hope until an email from a wounded slacktivist suggested they call the Wounded Social Justice Warrior Project® in Portland, Oregon.  The program provides personalized care, services, and advocacy to seriously wounded social justice warriors—including those who have suffered post traumatic stress disorder and other medical health conditions.  Besides adaptive and rehabilitative programs and caregiver support, the WSJWP also provides mentorship to recovering activists, an employment and career readiness program, and financial assistance for those who have suffered or aggravated an injury or illness and need help with daily living activities so they can avoid being hospitalized or put in an outpatient care facility.  For Prudence, the WSJWP has been a blessing. After a difficult and challenging three months in the program, Mrs. Bradley is starting to feel whole again, and is even looking forward to rejoining her fellow moonbats in time to protest the Republican National Convention next month in Jacksonville.  “I’ll be back,” said Mrs. Bradley with a new found sense of confidence. “I refuse to let these misogynists have the last laugh. This time I’ll be ready for them.” Prudence praises the WSJWP for giving her a second chance, not only at life, but a new sense of purpose to fight for social and economic justice. “This is my passion and I will never give up, ever.”  About the Wounded Social Justice Warrior Project®  The mission of the Wounded Social Justice Warrior Project® is to honor and empower our wounded heroes. Its purpose is to raise awareness of injured social activists, to help find them aid, and to provide unique, direct programs and services to help them continue with their activism. WSJWP is a national, nonpartisan organization headquartered in Portland, Oregon.  [adsforwp id=70836] Trump University Study Finds Correlation Between Menthol Cigarettes and Voter Fraud[] New York City, NY – As Donald Trump takes on the Republican establishment, Democrats and the mainstream media, he’s telling supporters they’re fighting against a “rigged” system, rife with voter fraud. The left, predictably, say talk like this is “dangerous” to the integrity of our electoral system, and then glibly ask for Mr. Trump to prove his voter fraud allegations.  Ask and ye shall receive.  Donald Trump’s campaign released a new study today that found a direct link between menthol cigarettes and widespread voter fraud.  Conducted by researchers at Trump University, the comprehensive study titled The Menthol Menace determined that menthol smokers have a genetic predisposition to commit in-person voter impersonation fraud.  “We found robust evidence that confirms a correlation between menthol cigarettes and voter fraud,” said Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway. “Once again Mr. Trump is 100% vindicated. Let’s see if the dishonest media will even report on this. I won’t be holding my breath.”  In typical fashion, progressives were quick to suggest that the study’s findings were somehow “racist” and dismissed them without further review. “Liberals want you to believe that only blacks smoke menthol cigarettes and therefore the findings are flawed and even racist. I think the American people are smarter than that,” Conway said.  Studies have shown that almost one in five African Americans smoke menthol cigarettes, almost three times the rate of whites.  Federal courts have time and again struck down sensible voter ID laws, concluding that minority voters are less likely to own a car and therefore less likely to obtain a driver’s license that could be used as an acceptable form of ID.  “Now that is racist…and total hogwash,” says former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. “If these people can’t obtain an ID then how are they buying all those menthol cigarettes they love so much? Answer me that.” Mr. Walker cited unverified claims of illegal immigrants voting over and over again at different polling locations using multiple fake IDs. “We must go further than strict voter ID laws, that’s why I am working on legislation that would require every Wisconsinite submit to an iris scan before they cast their ballot,” said Walker.  A similar study done by the Wyoming Institute of Technology found a direct link between menthol cigarettes and gang violence. The study found that gang violence was 16 times more likely to occur within a 5-mile radius of what the institute called “Menthol Center Zones.” The Menthol Menace concluded that polling stations within these “Menthol Center Zones” are likely to attract the highest concentration of fraudulent voters and should be heavily monitored on election day.  [adsforwp id=70836] Trump Administration to Launch “Black Beans Matter” Campaign[] <Washington, DC>The Trump Administration has launched a “Black Beans Matter” (“Frijoles Negros Importan”) campaign in support of a Goya Foods whose top executive was criticized last week for supporting President Trump. The campaign is focused on increasing sales of Mexican owned Goya food brands, as well as securing Latino votes for the upcoming election.  Critics of the president have been calling for a boycott of Goya after CEO Robert Unanue stated “We’re all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump, who is a builder” at a White House event. Unanue continued, “”He came to this country to build, to grow, to prosper. And so we have an incredible builder, and we pray for our leadership, our president, and we pray for our country that we will continue to prosper and to grow.””  The president’s daughter, who serves as a formal adviser to the president in the White House, tweeted late Tuesday in both English and Spanish along with a photo of her posing with can of black beans in support of the upcoming campaign.  The president again commented on the controversy Wednesday with the following tweet:  Critics of the president, as well as ethics officials, have criticized the move citing federal ethics law that states, in part, “An employee’s position or title should not be used to coerce; to endorse any product, service or enterprise; or to give the appearance of governmental sanction.” The Trump campaign has notoriously ignored the Hatch Act and this latest incident will likely be no different.  White House communications aide Carolina Hurley defended Ivanka’s tweet by stating: “Only the media and the cancel culture movement would criticize Ivanka for showing her personal support for a company that has been unfairly mocked, boycotted and ridiculed for supporting this administration — one that has consistently fought for and delivered for the Hispanic community,” adding “Ivanka is proud of this strong, Hispanic-owned business with deep roots in the U.S. and has every right to express her personal support.”  The announcement of the Black Beans Matter campaign has led to a fresh round of #BoycottGoya backlash, as well as outrage from supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement. Celebrities from Chrissy Teigen to Lin-Manuel Miranda, as well as politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have joined in the boycott and have used their massive platforms to draw attention to the cause.

    "Why More Americans Are Putting Off Having Kids[] A recent study found that the average age for new American parents is up to 26 for mothers and 31 for fathers, both record highs. The Onion looks at the top reasons why more Americans are putting off having kids.  Prison Tattoo Artist Always Forgetting Which Way Swastika Supposed To Go[]  Whoa, Opposing Little League Team Has Last Names On Their Jerseys[] CUDDEBACKVILLE, NY—Raising speculation as to whether the team was age-eligible for the game, incredulous little league sources confirmed Friday that Westchester Tigers players had their last names on the back of their jerseys. “These kids must be loaded,” said first-baseman Eric “Big Choo” Sanders, noting the opposing players’ matching cleats and baseball bats. “The second I saw those names, I knew we were fucked. Their jerseys are made by Adidas, we’ve got the logo of a pizzeria on our backs. I heard their assistant coach used to play for the Orioles, so he probably knows a guy. Their shortstop is nationally ranked, too. He’s got his nickname on his freaking glove.” At press time, little league sources announced that, holy shit, the Tigers had a team bus with a vinyl-wrapped graphic of their players.  If you suspect the chef has a vendetta against you and has sprinkled cyanide into your food, the least you could do is bring someone along to take that bullet for you. "
    "The Icelandic newspaper Stundin reports that a key witness in the US prosecution of Julian Assange has admitted in an interview with the outlet that he fabricated critical accusations in the indictment against the WikiLeaks founder. “A major witness in the United States’ Department of Justice case against Julian Assange has admitted to fabricating key accusations in the indictment against the Wikileaks founder,” Stundin reports. “The witness, who has a documented history with sociopathy and has received several convictions for sexual abuse of minors and wide-ranging financial fraud, made the admission in a newly published interview in Stundin where he also confessed to having continued his crime spree whilst working with the Department of Justice and FBI and receiving a promise of immunity from prosecution.” This major witness would be Iceland’s Sigurdur “Sigi” Thordarson, a paid FBI informant who after his short-lived association with WikiLeaks has been found guilty of sexually abusing nine boys as well as embezzlement, fraud, and theft in his home country. A court-appointed psychologist has found him to be a sociopath. “The court found that Sigurður is by all definitions a sociopath, suffering from a severe anti-social personality disorder. However, the court found that he did know the difference between right and wrong and could not be considered insane and could therefore stand trial,” Iceland Magazine reported in 2015 during Thordarson’s child abuse case. This was all public knowledge when the US government was building its case to extradite Julian Assange to America and try him under the Patriot Act for journalistic activity which exposed US war crimes, a prosecution for which Assange is still locked up in Belmarsh Prison pending Washington’s appeal of a UK court’s denial of the extradition request. And now we know for a fact that the odious person whose testimony formed the basis for much of that prosecution was lying. “US officials presented an updated version of an indictment against him to a Magistrate court in London last summer,” Stundin says. “The veracity of the information contained therein is now directly contradicted by the main witness, whose testimony it is based on.” What this means is that the US decided to add more accusations to its previous indictment because charging a journalist for standard journalistic practices was too weak on its own, and now this decision has bitten them in the ass. The article’s authors explain that contrary to the claims in that indictment, “Thordarson now admits to Stundin that Assange never asked him to hack or access phone recordings of MPs” and “further admits the claim, that Assange had instructed or asked him to access computers in order to find any such recordings, is false.” Thordarson’s testimony was cited extensively by British Magistrate Vanessa Baraitser when she was providing her ruling on the extradition request which is currently under appeal, and it looks pretty silly now that we know it was bogus. Her ruling repeats the prosecution’s claim that Assange “asked Teenager [code for Thordarson] to hack into computers to obtain information including audio recordings of phone conversations between high-ranking officials, including members of the Parliament,” but Thordarson has now recanted this claim. While the judgement on the extradition request reads, “It is alleged that Mr. Assange and Teenager failed a joint attempt to decrypt a file stolen from a ‘NATO country 1’ [ code for Iceland] bank”, Thordarson told Stundin that “this actually refers to a well publicised event in which an encrypted file was leaked from an Icelandic bank and assumed to contain information about defaulted loans provided by the Icelandic Landsbanki,” and that “Nothing supports the claim that this file was even ‘stolen’ per se, as it was assumed to have been distributed by whistleblowers from inside the failed bank.” While the ruling repeats the claim that Assange “used the unauthorized access given to him by a source, to access a government website of NATO country-1 used to track police vehicles,” Thordarson told Stundin that “Assange never asked for any such access.” These revelations are entirely damning. “This is the end of the case against Julian Assange,” tweeted NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, adding, “If Biden continues to seek the extradition of a publisher under an indictment poisoned top-to-bottom with false testimony admitted by its own star witness, the damage to the United States’ reputation on press freedom would last for a generation. It’s unavoidable.” “Now it’s time to have an international inquiry on how Sweden, UK, US, Ecuador and Australia have handled the Julian Assange case. My FOIA provides evidence nothing is normal in this case,” tweeted investigative journalist Stefania Maurizi. It just says so much that the most powerful government in the world, with all its essentially limitless resources, needed to build its case against Assange on false testimony from a diagnosed sociopath and convicted child molester. That’s how strong their case was against a journalist whose only “crime” was telling the truth about the powerful. This after we learned that Assange and his lawyers were spied on by the CIA, that he is being tortured, that his seven-year de facto imprisonment prior to his two-year stay in Belmarsh was arbitrary detention and unjust from the very beginning, and that the pretext for keeping him there was itself fallacious. This is a farce. The fact that this man remains behind bars is an outrage.   US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan Photo: AFPnnUS National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan threatened both China and Russia during his interviews with different media on Sunday. For Russia, he claimed that the US is preparing another package of sanctions in the case of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. This has shocked many peoples expectations of US-Russia relations after the two leaders summit. Sullivan also took a coercive tone to request China to cooperate with the further investigation into the origins of COVID-19; otherwise, China will face isolation in the international community. The US will not simply accept China saying no, he said.Sullivan has shown typical American arrogance of calling white black. Perhaps he and his colleagues think that the US strength can support them to do whatever they want, and they may believe the recent summits held by Western countries prove that the US still maintains the mobilization power to arbitrarily isolate a large country like China. When targeting China in his interview on Sunday, he used the phrase from that position of strength.The US is indeed the strongest country in the world. But the US ruling elites have seriously overestimated the international coercive force its national strength can produce. The US is still struggling with the Korean Peninsula and Iran issues, and the Afghanistan and Iraq wars it initiated have ended in chaos. Over the past one or two decades, the US has failed to do anything neatly and cleanly. When Sullivan confidently threatened China and Russia, his gestures were as hilarious as a bad boy in an elementary school class.China and Russia will undoubtedly refute Sullivan strongly. If Sullivan has normal self-esteem, he should feel a wind relentlessly blowing his spittle back to his own face.China will not accept any investigation by US intelligence agencies. If we find any trace of US intelligence agencies taking action in China, we will immediately strike heavily. The US does not have the final say on the origins tracing conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO). It must be carried out according to normal procedures. WHO experts have already conducted investigation in China and made their conclusion. The tracing of the COVID-19 origins needs to be done in multiple places in the world, including the US. This order of investigation cannot be changed by the US alone.Navalny serving jail sentence is Russias domestic affair. The more the US intervenes in it, the more clearly it shows that this is beyond Washingtons ability. On the one hand, the US intends to ease relations with Russia. On the other hand, it wants to bluff over the Navalny issue. When the US self-contradiction collides with Russias firm attitude of sticking to its principles, Washington will never take any advantage from it.The US advantage in strength cannot support the reckless display of its bad attitude toward China and Russia. The US cannot do anything to China and Russia, and this is the reality that the world can see and understand. The Trump administration made its efforts for years to weaken Beijing and Moscow, and it failed. Now the Biden administration has even fewer resources to flaunt its superiority. It wants to unite its allies to contain China and Russia, but it is ridiculous that it thinks this will have any strategic effect.What most European allies can contribute to the US is hollow words. They will never offer real benefits. The US wants to use the alliance system of the Cold War era to support a different kind of competition in the era of globalization - this is just like the US needs to build walls but the tool it finds is a cotton machine. China and Russia are not afraid of Washingtons new attempt of roping in allies. On the contrary, every move between China and Russia to further strengthen strategic cooperation can frighten many US and Western elites.The arrogant US ruling elites should curtail their arrogance. China and Russia will not take the initiative in provoking the US and its allies, but if they encounter new serious provocations, the two countries counterattack will be determined and immediate. In addition, we need to remind the US that it does not own UN agencies such as the WHO, nor can the West represent the international community. Washington needs to have more sense of shame and have a clearer estimation of itself. "
    "“China’s war against America has already started; however, the bombs have not been released— yet; but the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is serious and has plans to conquer America. World domination has been their vision for almost a hundred years and still is as the CCP celebrates its 100th anniversary this month. Last Thursday, Communist Butcher-in-chief Xi Jinping promised to bash any nation that threatened China’s sovereignty or threatened reunification with Taiwan.  What will Biden do when China takes Taiwan? According to his emails, Hunter Biden has had a longtime lucrative business relationship with the commies. (Been a long time since you’ve read that word.)  Fools, simpletons, and traitors ridicule the possibility of war and suggest such talk is divisive, dangerous, and destructive to a happy, cooperative, and safe society. They are wrong. China entered the 21st century as a benevolent giant trying to get along with everyone, so we are told. China makes its own people get along—or else.  China has been hesitant to be more aggressive with America because she is winning and doesn’t see a reason to hit the release button yet.  Scholars tell us that there has always been a China as long as man has “walked upright.” Extremely resilient, the Chinese survived centuries of numerous kingdoms, dynasties, warlords, military incursions, civil wars, floods, typhoons, and earthquakes. For example, the deadliest earthquake on record in 1556, in Shaanxi, China, killed 830,000 people and caused up to 66-feet-deep crevices. A 520-mile wide area was destroyed.  Millions of uneducated Chinese survived the climate catastrophes, internecine struggles, local warlords, and external attacks by developing small-scale industries. They produced silk, paper, gunpowder, and cotton that was traded for food while others farmed, trading food for shoes, tools, and other necessary items.  Millions were not successful in survival, thus making China a massive sepulcher.  China has attacked, absorbed, or acquired smaller groups and some massive groups of people and now shares international borders with 14 sovereign states such as India, Mongolia, Afghanistan, North Korea, Russia, Pakistan, etc. Over 1500 years, the reclusive nation built a 13,000-mile wall to protect it from foreign infiltration along its northern border from nomadic Mongolian tribes on horseback. Walls are known to stop cavalry attacks as well as most illegal immigrants. Additionally, the wall helped keep the natives down on the farm.  China’s first dynasty started in 2100 B.C., and the last dynasty ended in 1912, becoming the Republic of China. After many years of civil unrest and rebellion followed by WW II, the People’s Republic of China was birthed in 1949 after a bloody multi-year struggle with freedom-loving nationalists.  Chairman Mao Zedong led the CCP with an iron fist, and Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the opposing Nationalist Party, challenged the Chinese people for their loyalty. Chiang was born into a devoted Buddhist family but trusted Christ and was baptized in a Methodist Church in 1930. Finally, when Mao took control of the bleeding nation, Chiang absconded with about 2,000,000 followers (and the treasury) to the island of Formosa (now Taiwan) and established a Provisional Government.  Since then, China considers Taiwan a part of China, but Taiwan considers itself a sovereign nation. Even some U.S. “friends” refuse to call Taiwan a nation because it angers mainland China’s Communist tyrants. Nevertheless, America has promised to support Taiwan, and therein are the sprouting seeds of WW III.  Following WW II and the bloody struggle with the Nationalists, even a thuggish Communist like Mao knew the new nation was in trouble, so he kicked off the Great Leap Forward, hoping to change the rural agricultural society into an industrial one. His first mistake (other than taking the Communist oath) was to force simple farmers to set up “backyard steel furnaces” and meet strict production quotas; however, their steel production was a farce, failure, and fatal. The backyard steel was so brittle that it was useless.  Sure, it was stupid but remember, Mao was a Communist. The Great Leap Forward became a disastrous Fallback into Famine, resulting in the deaths of 56 million Chinese. Three million were suicides.  Chinese Communism differs from the old Soviet Communism, with the Chinese model adjusted from Marx to create state-controlled capitalism. Mao decided Marx was wrong because some capitalism (if controlled by the state) would be desirable. It might help the peasants think they are free even though the CCP owns a piece of everything. Chinese officials believe the “fat of the land” should be shared with the state. At one time, the power of the state was wielded behind the scenes; now, “the power would also be exercised explicitly.”  The CCP leaders admit the cooperative effort of the state with individuals is working. Everyone is happy, except those struggling to survive in the very rural hinterland. However, the residents of Hong Kong, Christians in the underground church, and assorted dissents are not thrilled with the repression of the CCP.  According to the Black Book of Communism, Communist policies in China have killed more than 65 million of its own people since its beginning in 1949. Plus, millions more died in its civil war, the Korean War, and in Tibet. Moreover, in recent years, China has harvested the organs of thousands of its prisoners, proving China is a horrific house of horrors.  China used to be our friend. Now, it is our enemy, along with Iran, Cuba, Russia, etc. The Soviet Union maneuvered China into its Communist orbit with the help of American traitors in our government in the 1940s. It is noteworthy that Senator Joseph McCarthy was not the first U.S. politician to warn about spies and the loss of China. A young Congressman from Massachusetts raised his voice a year before McCarthy.  The young Congressman sounded a clear, correct, and courageous voice because of the tragic loss of China. He placed a significant part of the blame on “a sick Roosevelt,” General George Marshall, and “our diplomats and their advisors, the Lattimores and the Fairbanks.” He concluded, “This is the tragic story of China whose freedom we once fought to preserve. What our young men had saved, our diplomats and our President have frittered away.” That Congressman was John F. Kennedy.  Kennedy was right and wrong. He was right that FDR was sick, but he was also soft on Communism and had Soviet agents whispering in his ear what they had heard from Stalin’s henchmen.  John Stewart Service was a U.S. diplomat stationed in Chungking, China, during the 1940s and lived with two Soviet agents. The song they constantly sang to the U.S. State Department was “we can’t trust the Conservative and Christian Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist Government, but we can trust Chairman Mao to do the best for China and the U.S.”  At the Cairo Conference on November 22-26, 1943, the tragic decision was made to follow Roosevelt’s demand that Chiang Kai-shek put Chinese Communists into his Nationalist Government! That’s worse than putting a fox in the henhouse. Changing metaphors, it’s worse than putting a homosexual pedophile in charge of a boys’ boarding school.  Compromised, corrupt, and cowardly U.S. diplomates convinced high Washington officials to withhold promised gold shipments to Chiang that would have supported his freedom fight. That treason permitted the Communists to get control of China. The traitors in high places kept aid from Chiang, assuring his defeat. When the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau, asked why Chiang wasn’t getting U.S. aid, he discovered it was because of a Soviet spy in the Treasury Department. Harry Dexter White was a significant player in the U. S. Treasury. White was considered the highest placed asset the Soviets possessed in the American government. Unfortunately, he died before meeting the hangman. However, he is paying for his treason at this moment!  Another Communist agent, Lauchlin Currie, a key advisor to President Roosevelt, worked hand in glove with White for the Soviets against freedom and was unalterably opposed to an American agreement with Japan in December 1941. Disloyal Americans hoped for a Japanese attack upon America, which happened on the 7th. This war in Asia was a significant boost to the Soviets, primarily assuring that Soviet troops in Siberia would not be bothered by Japanese troops since they would be engaged in fighting the Allies.  On November 25, 1941, Soviet spy Owen Lattimore, whom President Roosevelt had appointed special advisor to Chiang Kai-shek at Currie’s urging, sent a cable to Currie protesting against any settlement between America and Japan. The Soviets wanted war between America and Japan. They got it with the help of American traitors in the pay of the Soviet Union.  The despicable termites Currie (who emigrated in 1950 to Colombia and renounced his American citizenship), White (died before his trial), Hiss (spent a few years in prison), and others were busy doing their destructive work to help the Soviet masters and hinder freedom. The FBI sent President Truman a report of White’s espionage activities on December 4, 1945, with copies to Attorney General Thomas Clark. The FBI reported a “substantial spy ring” operating in the government involving White. Well, that should clear out one nest of termites, but no, on January 23, 1946, President Truman announced White’s appointment to head the International Monetary Fund!  No, all Democrats are not spies or senile. Most are simply stupid.  China fell to Communism because of Soviet agents in the U.S. State Department. Consequently, Chiang relocated his Nationalist Government, air force, navy, and the government‘s gold to Taiwan about 70 miles from mainland China.  One and a half billion people live under Chinese Communism today because the U.S. government failed to deal with spies in high leadership positions. It is the reason there is a “two China” policy where the Peoples’ Republic of China controls the mainland and the Republic of China located in Taiwan claims to be an independent nation. Mainland China considers Taiwan part of China. With only 24 million population, Taiwan is like a minnow about to be swallowed by a giant shark.  If the CCP received the nod, they would destroy Taiwan or the U.S. with nuclear bombs or, more likely, with an EMP weapon whereby our cities would be unscathed but literally forced back into the 1800s. That means no cell phones, no computers, no heat or air, no elevators, and probably no modern automobile would function. Forbes reported, “China now has super-EMP weapons, knows how to protect itself against an EMP attack, and has developed protocols to conduct a first-strike attack, even as they deny they would ever do so.”  Communist agents in our government were very successful in turning China over to Communism’s orbit, damning the lives of millions of unfortunate souls, and setting the stage for the final drama facing the free world. It could happen tomorrow and kick off WW III.  China’s war against America has already started; however, the bombs have not been released— yet.
