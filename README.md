# TruthBeTold
'''TruthBeTold is an online platform that sheds 
light on the accuracy of information on the Internet. 
Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, 
we strive to build a platform that will combat the rise 
of fake news, preventing the goodwill of society from being 
eclipsed by the badwill of a few.

It will:

- access the content of news channels using their API's
- using probability, nltk, n-grams, tokenization, and 
    (to keep things simple) the rules of the English language
    (Syntax, grammer, semantics (nuance)), derive the message 
    of the article
    - There should definitely be useful modules to use
- Based on PAST data about the website on 
  this subject, plus some additional
  context info about the particular topic, generate
  a % likelihood that the info in this article is right
- **Give the user the ability to 'rate' the score; the way they vote 
  will marginally change the score displayed
- prompt the user if they want to evaluate another website
